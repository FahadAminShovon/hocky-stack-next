# Hocky stack front end assessment

The project is hosted here https://hocky-stack-next.vercel.app/


## short description
the table is built from scratch, without using any external utility library like tanstack-table

data file location -> src/app/data
server action -> src/app/actions/get-data-action.ts
table render -> src/app/TableView.tsx
table component -> src/app/Table

**Table component has been broken down into 3 components for better readability**
## how to improve the project
* Currently the pagination is done on the frontend, as the data grows , it'll be beneficial to do server side pagination
* add search functionality
* the table causes layoutshift if url is too big, it should be handled
* pagination only shows prev and next, can be improved to have pagination like 1,2 ... 10
* the urls should be truncated and on hover should show the url details along with full url
* The file is hosted from nextjs server for ease of use, it can be hosted separately
* tanstack-table has some beautiful type utilities, those can be used for better typesafe column generation

## short-cuts I have taken
* Using shadcn components to build ui like cards
* the ui is enhanced using v0.dev ai
* the score calculation is generated by chatgpt
* using react-hook-form type utilities instead of writing my own type or searching for other appropriate type libraries
* instead of a separate server, server actions is used to fetch the data
